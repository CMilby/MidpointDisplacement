Midpoint Displacement Algorithm
===============================
One way to create "realistic" looking moutains is the use the Midpoint Displacement Algorithm, a type of Diamond-Square Algorithm. My implementation uses recurssion to split a line in half 2^X times then draws it the the panel. Press any button to recreate and redraw it.
